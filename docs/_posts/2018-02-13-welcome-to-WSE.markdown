WSE (Wannabe Software Engineer) is just my personal recopilation of information on the excellent guide written by John Washam (github: 'jwasham').
This is not intended to be read by anyone and early code can be (and will be) very buggy.

I intend to write a bit (almost) every day about the things I learn and put some code examples as well.
